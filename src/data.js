      description: "Colour abstraction is characterized by the use of color to make the objects appear as detached from reality. The color-related or light-related art is observed in the works of Oscar Claude Monet and Joseph Mallord William Turner. This type is characterized by a swirl of pigment in every painting, which eventually makes the pigment indistinguishable.",

      description: "Gestural abstract refers to a particular process of making art. In gesture art, the process of creating paintings becomes central because artists of this style often use brushes in unconventional ways, and the brushwork is in many cases, rapid and loose. Here, the subject of the painting is not essential; instead, it is the way it gets painted. While most art forms have a conscious approach to applying paint, gestural depends on intuition.",

      description: "Abstract geometric art appeared in 1908, represented by such movements as Cubism. As its name suggests, geometric abstraction is a form of abstract which uses geometric forms and shapes like squares, triangles, rectangles, and circles. As art styles became more and more boundless in the 20th century, geometric abstraction gradually gained in popularity. The logic of perspective underpins Renaissance art as an attempt to make objects as real and lifelike as possible. Geometric abstraction is quite the opposite because of its two-dimensional approach.",
