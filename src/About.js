        description: "Though Vasily Kandinsky pursued figurative art before 1913, he was among the first (if not the first) painters to push into pure abstraction—or as he put it, “art independent of one’s observations of the external world.” He especially believed that color could be separated from all external references and become a subject for art. His 1910 book, On the Spiritual In Art, laid out his theories, and became one of the Ur texts of 20th-century Modernism.",

        description: "Along with Picasso, Mondrian is synonymous with Modern Art, and the mere mention of his name immediately conjures one of his iconic geometric compositions of primary-colored squares contained by bold, black perpendicular lines. Like many early modernists, Mondrian began by working in various styles influenced by Post-Impressionism, with echoes of Seurat and Van Gogh reverberating through his scenes of the Dutch countryside.

        description: "Born in Latvia, Mark Rothko vies with Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning for the title of the most famous Abstract Expressionist artist. In terms of style if not of temperament, however, Rothko’s work differed from Pollock and De Kooning in the way he diffused paint all over the canvas rather than subject it to gestural attacks. A typical Rothko sets expansive blobs of pigment stacked atop each other against painted backdrops that reveal themselves along the edges of the composition.",

        description: "The face of Abstract Expressionism and America’s first major postwar artist (and still one of its greatest), Pollock burst onto the scene in the late 1940s and early 1950s with his signature drip paintings. They were created in an incandescent burst of creativity over a three years period between 1947 and 1950 at his Springs, New York studio in the Hamptons. His technique was famously captured by Hans Namuth, who photographs show the artist flinging commercial house-paint out of a can onto an unprimed canvas laid on the floor—a performative process that lent the moniker “action painting” to his work and that of other Abstract Expressionists.",

        description: "Born in Saskatchewan, Agnes Martin is often called a pioneer of Minimal Art. However, she regarded herself as an Abstract Expressionist, though you might be forgiven for wondering how she’d think so, given her nuanced compositions of grids and bands painted in barely-there colors. But there were that other artists associated with AbEx who likewise worked in uniformly painted styles, such as Barnett Newman and Ad Reinhardt. She shared Newman’s emphasis on eliciting an emotional—even epiphanic—response from the viewer over the idea of capturing the artist’s emotions in a gesture. ",
